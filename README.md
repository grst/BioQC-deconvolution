# BioQC significance    

The purpose of this repository is to better understand the siginicance of BioQC scores, and eventually find a way to correct them so that they are proportional to the abundance of the tissue/cell line/... with the ultimate goal of deconvolution. 

## Proposal on score correction
https://rawgit.com/grst/BioQC-significance/master/how_to_correct_bioqc_scores.html

The method is applied in [deconvolution.ipynb](deconvolution.ipynb)


## Simulation studies
* How does the size of a signature influence the score?

* What minimal score can be expected if two signatures overlap?
